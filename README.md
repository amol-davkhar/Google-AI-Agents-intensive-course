# 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course - Project Repository

## Overview
This repository documents my learning and projects from the **5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course** with **Google and Kaggle (November 10-14, 2025)**. The course focuses on building intelligent, autonomous AI agents using **Google's Gemini API** and modern agentic frameworks.

---

## About the Course
The 5-Day AI Agents Intensive is a free, structured online program created by Google's AI researchers and engineers. It covers both the theoretical foundations and hands-on applications of AI agents, progressing from simple agents to full multi-agent systems.
