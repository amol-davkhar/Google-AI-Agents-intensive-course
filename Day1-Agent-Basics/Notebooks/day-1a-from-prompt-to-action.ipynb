An agent can do more than just respond to a prompt — it can **take actions** to find information or get things done.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Install [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Configure your API key to use the Gemini model\n- ✅ Build your first simple agent\n- ✅ Run your agent and watch it use a tool (like Google Search) to answer a question","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 📖 Get started with Kaggle Notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using Kaggle Notebooks, welcome! You can learn more about using Kaggle Notebooks [in the documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks).\n\nHere's how to get started:\n\n**1. Verify Your Account (Required)**\n\nTo use the Kaggle Notebooks in this course, you'll need to verify your account with a phone number.\n\nYou can do this in your [Kaggle settings](https://www.kaggle.com/settings).\n\n**2. Make Your Own Copy**\n\nTo run any code in this notebook, you first need your own editable copy.\n\nClick the `Copy and Edit` button in the top-right corner.\n\n![Copy and Edit button](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5gdai_sc_1.png)\n\nThis creates a private copy of the notebook just for you.\n\n**3. Run Code Cells**\n\nOnce you have your copy, you can run code.\n\nClick the ▶️ Run button next to any code cell to execute it.\n\n![Run cell button](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5gdai_sc_2.png)\n\nRun the cells in order from top to bottom.\n\n**4. If You Get Stuck**\n\nTo restart: Select `Factory reset` from the `Run` menu.\n\nFor help: Ask questions on the [Kaggle Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kaggle) server.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ⚙️ Section 1: Setup\n\n### Install dependencies\n\nThe Kaggle Notebooks environment includes a pre-installed version of the

Since it's currently November, here are some excellent options for both November and December, categorized by the type of trip you might desire:\n\n**For Warm Weather and Beaches:**\n\n*   **Thailand:** December offers pleasant weather with sunshine and no rain, making it peak season for beach lovers and divers. Temperatures range from 15-27°C (59-81°F).\n*   **Australia:** As the Southern Hemisphere experiences summer, December is ideal for enjoying beaches, vibrant cities, and outdoor festivities. Sydney's New Year's Eve fireworks are a major draw.
